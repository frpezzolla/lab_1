Humankind has been around for roughly more than 26 years, and so have been academic disciplines that have set out to explain its intricacies and peculiarities. One specimen of such group is Fabrizzio Pezzolla, a student of Master's in Data Science at University of Chile. We have employed qualitative analysis to characterise this specimen in accordance to the First Laboratory Assignment (FiLA) parameters for the current iterations of class Laboratorio de Programación Científica para Ciencia de Datos (LaProCiCiDa) and present our findings in markdown format.
